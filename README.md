📡 Audio Beacon – Proximity Interaction Using Sound
<!-- Replace or remove this if not using -->

🔊 Transform Physical Spaces Into Smart Interactions
Audio Beacon is a proximity-based communication system that uses unique audio signals to trigger actions on nearby smartphones — without GPS, Bluetooth, or internet. Designed for accessibility, smart retail, education, and beyond, it’s a lightweight and cost-effective solution for seamless interaction between devices and environments.

Open a webpage

Send a notification

Speak a location

🧪 Use Cases
🖼️ Museum: Get exhibit info when near

🛒 Retail: Show discounts near store entrance

🚌 Transport: Announce bus stop to the visually impaired

🏠 Home: Trigger automation based on room entry
